# DiffusionModel

This repository contains the implementation of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM).
DDPM is a powerful generative model that can be used for image synthesis, denoising, and inpainting tasks.
It is based on the diffusion process, where an image is iteratively transformed to gradually reveal the underlying structure.
